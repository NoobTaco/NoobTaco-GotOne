**Your Collection, Your Soundtrack.**

**NoobTaco GotOne** is a high-performance, audio-only notification system for World of Warcraft collectors. It delivers the satisfying "dopamine hit" of adding to your collection—mounts, pets, toys, and transmog—without touching your UI.

## The "Invisible" Powerhouse
Most collection addons rely on heavy databases and complex UI overlays that clutter your screen and impact performance. **GotOne** runs entirely in the background, listening for that one specific moment of success so you can stay focused on the game.

* **Zero UI Footprint:** No frames to move, no anchors to set, and no windows blocking your view. It stays invisible so you can stay immersed.
* **LSM Customization:** Assign unique chimes, orchestral hits, or custom clips to different categories:
    * **Mounts:** A grand fanfare.
    * **Pets:** A subtle chirp.
    * **Transmog:** A clean, metallic "clink."
    * **Toys:** A whimsical chime.
* **Near-Zero Impact:** No visual rendering or complex database scanning—ideal for high-end raiding or dense open-world farming.

---

## Power User Features
* **Event-Specific Audio:** Assign different sounds for Mounts, Pets, Toys, and Appearances.
* **LibSharedMedia (LSM) Integrated:** Automatically detects any sound packs you already have installed (like `SharedMedia`).
* **Zero UI Footprint:** No windows to manage; config is handled via a simple slash command or the standard Blizzard Addon panel.
* **Anti-Spam Logic:** Intelligent handling for when you learn multiple appearances at once so your ears aren't overwhelmed.
