# NoobTaco GotOne

**Hear the win. Lose the bloat.**

**NoobTaco GotOne** is a high-performance, audio-only notification system for World of Warcraft collectors. It delivers the satisfying "dopamine hit" of adding to your collection—mounts, pets, toys, and transmog—without the screen clutter or system weight of massive tracking suites.

## Why GotOne?

Most collection addons rely on heavy databases and complex UI overlays that can tank your FPS and clutter your screen. **GotOne** takes a different approach:

* **Zero UI Footprint:** No frames to move, no anchors to set, and no windows blocking your view. It stays invisible so you can stay immersed in the world.
* **Audio-Driven Feedback:** Get immediate confirmation when a new item is added to your collection through high-quality audio cues. 
* **Performance-First:** Built to be ultra-lean with near-zero CPU usage. It’s the perfect companion for high-end raiding or intensive open-world farming.
* **The "All The Things" Feeling:** Get that same sense of reward and progression every time you learn something new, just without the administrative overhead.

## Features

* **Smart Notifications:** Distinct audio alerts for Mounts, Pets, Toys, and Appearances.
* **Perfect Defaults:** Comes pre-configured with a curated set of high-fidelity sounds that feel rewarding right out of the box.
* **Full LSM Support:** Fully integrated with **LibSharedMedia**. Don’t like our sounds? Bring your own. Use any audio file available to your client to customize every collection event.
* **Lightweight Logic:** Intelligent event handling ensures you aren't overwhelmed by "audio spam" when learning multiple appearances at once (e.g., opening multiple boxes or caches).

## Installation

1.  Download the latest release from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/noobtaco-gotone) or [GitHub].
2.  Extract the folder into your `Interface/AddOns` directory.
3.  Ensure you have an LSM provider (like `SharedMedia`) installed if you wish to use external custom sounds.

## Configuration

**NoobTaco GotOne** is designed to be "Plug & Play," but you can customize your experience via the standard Blizzard Addon compartment or via slash command:

* `/gotone` - Opens the configuration panel.
* **Custom Sounds:** Use the dropdown menus to select from available LibSharedMedia audio files for each collection category.
